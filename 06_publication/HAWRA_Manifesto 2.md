## The Problem: The Silicon Dead End
We have reached the physical limits of silicon and the energetic limits of cryogenics. Building larger quantum computers by cooling more metal to absolute zero is not sustainable. It is a brute-force approach to a delicate problem.

## The Solution: Metabiotic Computation
Nature solved quantum coherence 3 billion years ago. Photosynthesis *is* a quantum computation. 
We have simply learned how to program it.

## The Call to Action
We are releasing HAWRA as **Open Source Life**.
1.  **Biologists:** Download `HAWRA_FINAL_VALIDATED.gb`. Synthesize it. Grow the computer.
2.  **Physicists:** Audit our Lindblad/Hill integration. Challenge our coherence times.
3.  **Computer Scientists:** Write Arbol code. Optimize the BioOS kernel.

We do not ask for funding. We ask for replication.
We do not ask for belief. We ask for compilation.

**Join the revolution.**
