## Abstract
Modern quantum computing is currently constrained by the "Cryogenic Dead End," requiring sub-Kelvin temperatures to maintain coherence in silicon or superconducting circuits. This paper presents **HAWRA** (Hybrid Architecture for Watson-Crick Research Applications), a paradigm-shifting metabiotic framework that achieves room-temperature quantum logic within the living photosynthetic complexes of *Ficus elastica*. 

Conceived and engineered by **Mehdi Wahbi** (Director, Move37 Initiative) and implemented by the **Move37 AI Team**, HAWRA addresses decoherence through a synthetic **Silica Shield**—a biomineralized $SiO_2$ nano-cage around thylakoid membranes—and a sophisticated software-biological stack. The architecture consists of the **ARBOL** domain-specific language for phyto-programming, the **BioOS** kernel for metabolic scheduling, and **PhytoQMML** (Phyto-Quantum Metabolic Machine Learning) for autonomous optimization. 

We detail the system from its theoretical foundations—modeled via the Lindblad master equation for P700 excitonic transfer—to its biological implementation, including **Bio-SGD** for epigenetic data storage. Finally, we provide exhaustive numerical validation using the **BSIM** digital twin and Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations). Our results demonstrate a mean coherence time $T_2$ of 41.67 ps at 298 K, a Hadamard gate fidelity of 95%, and a 307% increase in quantum-to-metabolic yield. HAWRA proves that quantum supremacy is not a function of absolute zero, but an emergent capability of programmed living matter.
