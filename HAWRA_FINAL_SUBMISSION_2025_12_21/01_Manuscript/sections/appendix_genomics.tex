\section{Biomineralization Equations of the Silica Shield}

The formation of the protective silica nanostructure around the computational chloroplasts is governed by the polycondensation of silicic acid, catalyzed by biogenic silaffin peptides expressed via the \textit{Lsi1} module:

\begin{equation}
nSi(OH)_4 \xrightarrow{\text{Silaffin}} [SiO_{x}(OH)_{4-2x}]_n + nH_2O
\end{equation}

The deposition kinetics are dynamically regulated by the \texttt{BioOS} through precise adjustment of the intracellular pH and ionic strength. This allows the system to modulate the thickness of the \textit{Silica Shield} (and consequently the $T_2$ coherence time) in response to varying levels of environmental electromagnetic noise.

\section{Deep Learning-Driven Promoter Optimization}

All regulatory elements, including the modified \textit{p35S} and \textit{psbA} promoters, were optimized using a genomic transformer model (\textit{DNA-BERT}). The objective function for this optimization was to ensure a strictly linear transcriptional response to the specific LED intensities and wavelengths used by the Jetson actuator. This linearity is crucial for minimizing systematic errors and non-linearities in the execution of continuous-variable quantum gates within the biological substrate.
