# HAWRA Press Kit 2026 📰

## The Project: HAWRA (Hardware-Agnostic Wetware-Reliant Architecture)
HAWRA is a pioneering open-science initiative that successfully merged **Quantum Computing** with **Synthetic Biology**. For the first time, a living plant (*Ficus elastica*) has been transformed into a biological quantum computer (PQPE) capable of executing complex algorithms at room temperature.

## Why it Matters (The Impact)
1. **Sustainability**: Traditional quantum computers require near-absolute zero temperatures (-273°C). HAWRA works at ambient temperature using natural photosynthesis.
2. **Open Science**: The entire architecture, from genetic code to quantum compiler, is open-source.
3. **Living Hardware**: It introduces "Wetware" as a viable, carbon-sequestering alternative to silicon-based computing.

## Key Achievements (2025-2026)
- **Validated Quantum Logic**: Successful execution of Grover's Search and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms in a biological substrate.
- **T2 Coherence Breakthrough**: Genetic engineering of a "Silica Shield" to protect quantum states within the plant's cells.
- **Arbol Language**: Creation of the first programming language for living matter.
- **Synthesis Ready**: The project has moved from theoretical models to validated DNA synthesis protocols.
