# Contributing to HAWRA

Thank you for your interest in the Hardware-Agnostic Wetware-Reliant Architecture (HAWRA) project. As a project at the intersection of quantum physics, synthetic biology, and computer science, we welcome contributions from diverse fields.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

1. **Research & Feedback:** Review our [Scientific Rationale](docs/index.html) and [Documentation](docs/HAWRA_Comprehensive_Documentation.tex) and provide feedback via Issues.
2. **Arbol Language:** Suggest improvements to the Arbol DSL specification or contribute new example scripts in `src/arbol/`.
3. **Simulation:** Improve the HAWRA-Sim engines in `src/simulator/` to include more complex biological noise models.
4. **Genomics:** Propose optimizations for the HAWRA-PQPE plasmid sequence.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

- **Scientific Rigor:** All technical contributions must be grounded in peer-reviewed literature or verifiable simulation results.
- **Safety First:** Contributions involving biological sequences must adhere to international biosafety guidelines.
- **Ethics:** We prioritize the ethical implications of wetware computing.

## 🛠 Development Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run tests: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.
